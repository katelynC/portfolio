      <p>Here are some projects I have worked on:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A full text-based Java representation of the board game "Mancala"</li>
        <li>A children's online coloring program, written in Python</li>
        <li>Creating structural code in R to help a start-up tech team design an app to aid in educational and career choices.</li>
      </ol>

      <p></br>This is a full paragraph to add more length to this website, such that
        the function of the above 'scroll-bar' can properly be shown. If I knew
        any solid jokes off the top of my head, I would put those jokes down here.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, most of my favorite humor comes from memes, and that's
        too much work to embed here simply to add length to one of the pages
        on my website. Thus, I will continue taking up space</p>

      <p>with this multitude of paragraphs. I just realized that</p>

      <p>Simply making several shorter paragraphs would use up space more efficiently
        than actually writing out multiple entire paragraphs. Or just making the font
        bigger, or the margins</p>

      <p>larger... Perhaps I</p>

      <p>shall try that next if</p>

      <p>this doesn't do</p>

      <p>it.</p>
